DEPLOYED SITE - https://news-pp.netlify.app/
i have had deployed the site on this link .. but due to the link being limited to the fact that it can be accessed through local host only due to it being a paid API... u have to copy this react-js to your system and then 
run        npm run build
then... open the website through that build
